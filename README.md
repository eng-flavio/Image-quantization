 Image Quantization in Python
 
  ## Prerequisites
  - [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/)
  - Install the most recently version of the frameworks and libraries required (`numpy`,`matplotlib` and `pylab`)
  - A  image (I am adding a *.jpg* that worked for me)
  ## Instructions for use
  - Change the input from line 9: `img = pylab.imread("img2.jpg")` to the desired image
  - The image will be converted to 256 levels in **gray scale** and re-quantized  to 128, 32 and 4 shades of gray, like the image below:
